    "This archive is not designed for perfect retrieval. It is designed to shape attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Search works well enough at this scale of all of my files (~10 TB); the real problem is not finding files, but remembering what is worth looking for. Flat abundance collapses curiosity. When everything is equally accessible, habit wins, and familiar choices dominate. This taxonomy exists to reintroduce texture, constraint, and adjacency so that discovery becomes possible again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Folders answer the question “what kind of thing is this?” They do not answer what the thing means, why it matters, or how it relates to other things. Meaning lives in metadata, memory, and context. The folder structure is deliberately boring at the top and deliberately opinionated where browsing matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "This system distinguishes between taxonomy and ontology. Ontology asks what something truly is; taxonomy asks where it should live so it can be encountered. The archive does not attempt to be a perfect model of reality. It attempts to be a usable map. Predictable misclassification is acceptable and even desirable. Search exists as a safety net, not as the primary interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different media demand different depths of structure. Photos, documents, data, and projects benefit from shallow hierarchies and strong metadata because retrieval is goal-directed. Books, music, and films benefit from deeper, semantic hierarchies because browsing, recognition, and serendipity are the primary modes of engagement. In these domains, deeper folders are not bureaucracy; they are shelves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is based on how one wants to arrive at an artifact, not on an abstract definition of what it is. An album that spans multiple genres is placed in the location that matches the listening intention it best serves. Each artifact has one canonical home. That home reflects a choice about behavior, not truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Projects are explicitly separated from the archive. Projects are allowed to be messy, temporary, and mutable. When a project ends, its outputs are promoted into the archive and reclassified according to artifact type. This separation prevents entropy from spreading.\n",
    "\n",
    "The archive is meant to be walked, not queried. Each directory should be small enough to browse without fatigue and rich enough to invite exploration. Constraint is not a limitation; it is the mechanism by which curiosity reappears.\n",
    "\n",
    "This taxonomy is expected to evolve. Changes should be deliberate and documented, not reactive. The structure should age alongside its owner. Consistency matters more than correctness, and memory is reinforced through use, not optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The success criterion of this system is not whether a file can be found instantly. The success criterion is whether the archive invites engagement, supports discovery, and gently resists the pull of the familiar.\n"

    "This notebook defines and enforces the physical structure of the archive. It creates the directory taxonomy that all automated and manual classification must target. The notebook does not move files, interpret content, or decide meaning; it establishes the stable destinations that give those future decisions somewhere to land.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure produced here is intentionally explicit and repeatable. By materializing the taxonomy as directories, the notebook turns an abstract organizational philosophy into a concrete constraint. Any AI agent operating on the archive is required to place artifacts into one and only one canonical location within this structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook serves as the contract between human intention and automated action. It makes the rules visible, inspectable, and versionable. An AI agent may misclassify, but it may not invent categories. Corrections happen by relocating artifacts within the existing structure, not by reshaping the structure itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation is deliberate. The notebook defines the “where.” The AI agent decides the “which.” Search remains the safety net, but browsing is the primary interface. Together, they form a system in which automation accelerates organization without erasing human judgment.\n"
